A tool that gather some of the best frontend development rss feeds in a single place.

A personal project to self learning Expo + React Native, as well with some node and Vercel integration.

## why this weird name
Maritaca, baitaca and suia are common names for several species of birds, similar to parrots. 

They sing too loud, and every morning come to my window, wake up me and my family like saying "I bring fresh news for today"
