This manifesto contained certain values and principles that guide developers and testers to break the project into smaller parts, accelerate feedback loops and align product features with customer needs. The early adopters of agile methodology were small software start-ups that were eager to disrupt the market and were willing to take the risk. As this methodology matured, large enterprises started adopting it. The agile approach worked fine for some time as it helped developers to produce software in smaller parts. But later, it was realized that it lacks the capability of continuous testing and continuous delivery.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Due to the rising need for faster releases, high-quality software and faster time-to-market, businesses needed advanced methodologies such as DevOps processes. Companies started shifting from Agile to DevOps methodology as it helped them in many ways as listed below:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Breaks silos between cross-functional teams, thus enabling more collaboration</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Allows teams to continuously test and improve the code thus ensuring the software fits customer needs</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Ensures continuous delivery of the product by enabling a CI/CD pipeline</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Helps businesses to improve overall organizational culture and ensures early-to-market with faster and continuous releases</p>\n<p><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Significance of DevOps CI/CD Implementation in today’s Agile Environment\"></a><strong>Significance of DevOps CI/CD Implementation in today’s Agile Environment</strong></h2>\n</p>\n<p><center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20584\" src=\"https://www.testingxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Significance-of-DevOps-CICD-implementation-in-today’s-agile-environment.jpg\" alt=\"DevOps CICD implementation\" width=\"826\" height=\"382\" /></center></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD), wherein a modern software coding philosophy allows developers to implement small changes and check code frequently. The main goal of CI is to establish a consistent and automated way to build, package, and test applications. CD is closely related to CI and enables automation of the entire software delivery process by leveraging automation tools. Further, it commits and delivers the integrated code into the production stage without any bugs or delays.</p>\n<p>Both CI and CD are the backbone of today’s DevOps environment. There are various benefits that businesses can leverage by implementing the DevOps CI/CD pipeline.</p>\n<h3><strong>• Helps in early bug detection –</strong></h3>\n<p>Automated tests enabled by implementing CI/CD pipeline helps to detect bugs early in the SDLC.</p>\n<h3><strong>• Improves the software quality –</strong></h3>\n<p>Faster bug detection ensures faster bug-fixing and ultimately helps to ensure secure and reliable software.</p>\n<h3><strong>• Ensures faster time-to-market- </strong></h3>\n<p>Enabling CI/CD pipelines helps to increase the speed of software delivery considerably. It further helps businesses to reach the market faster and achieve a competitive edge.</p>\n<h3><strong>• Allows faster feedback –</strong></h3>\n<p>Typically, for any changes committed to the code, tests are run simultaneously, which helps to avoid any link breakage. Faster feedback through CI tools helps to check and improve the product quality.</p>\n<h3><strong>• Provides greater visibility –</strong></h3>\n<p>The CI/D pipelines give greater visibility of the entire DevOps process. This helps teams analyze the processes of software build, test results, and issues effectively.</p>\n<h3><strong>• Automation saves QA teams time and efforts – </strong></h3>\n<p>Automated CI/CD pipelines frees up team members so that they can focus on more important tasks and innovation. This ultimately saves their time and testing efforts.</p>\n<p>Evidently, for businesses to reap complete benefits, they should embark on scalable CI/CD DevOps implementations by leveraging various software testing methods.</p>\n<p><h2><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Major Software Testing Types for Successful DevOps CI/CD Implementation\"></a><strong>Major Software Testing Types for Successful DevOps CI/CD Implementation</strong></h2>\n</p>\n<p><center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20585\" src=\"https://www.testingxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Major-software-testing-types-for-successful-DevOps-CICD-implementation.jpg\" alt=\"Major software testing types for successful DevOps CICD\" width=\"826\" height=\"382\" /></center></p>\n<h3><strong>1.

The highly dynamic mobile app market that’s home to a diverse range of devices, operating systems and screen sizes makes mobile app testing even harder. How do you determine that your testing efforts are enough? Is your strategy really the ideal one?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/webinars/mobile-app-testing-redefined\">In this webinar</a>, Simon Berner, a Test Automation Engineer at House of Test and a Git instructor, talks about the things that dev and QA teams need to be mindful of while testing mobile apps. He also discusses the best tools and ideas to make your strategy more effective, and more.</p><p>Along the way, Simon was asked questions about the best ways to approach mobile app testing. Here's a roundup of his answers to questions that we couldn’t cover during the webinar:</p><h3 id=\"when-writing-tests-for-ios-and-android-versions-of-the-same-app-that-have-similar-functionality-do-people-use-one-test-script-for-both-or-have-one-test-script-for-each\">When writing tests for iOS and Android versions of the same app that have similar functionality, do people use one test script for both or have one test script for each?</h3><p>If you have to write tests for an app that shall run on iOS and Android, I strongly recommend that you build your automation framework in a way that supports running the same test script on both platforms. With that, it is much easier to create, maintain and expand your tests.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-test-when-creating-a-global-website-international-ux-localization-\">How do you test when creating a global website (international UX/localization)?</h3><p>In a lot of cases, localization can be tested by testing the translation texts which are usually hosted in corresponding translation files or a separate system/service. The challenge, though, is to test what the UI will look like when translated to different languages.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"which-tools-would-you-recommend-for-both-black-box-and-white-box-testing\">Which tools would you recommend for both black-box and white-box testing?</h3><p>This depends on what, why and how you want to test. For mobile app testing, you want to cover your frontend (the app itself) and also the backend services with some tests. For black-box testing of an app, I highly recommend making use of a debugging proxy like Charles Proxy. Further, for UI automation, you can use Appium, XCUITest and Espresso.</p><p>For black-box testing of backend services, I can recommend using Postman for API testing. For white-box testing (automation) on iOS, you could, for example, use XCUITest, and on Android Espresso and JUnit5.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"can-you-recommend-some-good-resources-for-writing-good-test-cases\">Can you recommend some good resources for writing good test cases?</h3><p>If your goal is to document your exploratory testing endeavors, then asking the following questions might help you to progress:<br>- Why do you need to write/document tests?<br>- Who wants to have them, and why in a written form?<br>- Who will gain value from it?<br>- Who is going to maintain them?<br>- Where do you want to put them to make them accessible for others?<br>- Can session-based testing help? (see <a href=\"https://www.satisfice.com/download/session-based-test-management\">Session-Based Test Management</a> )</p><p>If your goal is to write some automated tests, this post is still relevant and has some good hints - <a href=\"https://devops.com/10-rules-for-writing-automated-tests/\">10 Rules for Writing Automated Tests - DevOps.com</a> <br><br></p><h3 id=\"when-you-set-out-to-begin-a-project-or-a-feature-how-much-time-do-you-budget-for-testing-if-you-expect-a-feature-will-take-10-hours-to-develop-what-percent-of-that-time-do-you-set-aside-for-testing\">When you set out to begin a project or a feature, how much time do you budget for testing? If you expect a feature will take 10 hours to develop, what percent of that time do you set aside for testing?</h3><p>Estimating how long it takes to test “something” (in one go) in the context of software development is hard. Better try to slice your testing efforts into smaller pieces by defining your first time-boxed test session. Depending on what you are able to cover through testing and how many issues you find in that session, you are better able to predict how long it may take to finish your testing efforts. But even then, keep in mind that you are never really done with testing. It's the question of what is the risk the team is willing to take (and/or the budget limitations) to stop testing.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"need-more-information-about-the-productive-preview-app-and-how-is-it-different-from-an-internal-test-app-or-beta-testing\">Need more information about the ‘Productive Preview App’ and how is it different from an internal test app or beta testing?</h3><p>In our case, the Productive Preview App is a full-fledged version/copy of our Productive Main App. Both of them are available on the app stores. What is different though, is that in the preview app we add some shiny new features first and let the end-users use/test them in production. Once we have collected enough feedback from the end-users, we see if we have to rework them or not. Later the decision is made whether or not will we definitely release them in our Productive Main App. With that, we kind of follow something similar like a <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html\">canary release strategy</a>.<br><br></p><h3 id=\"how-many-on-premise-devices-do-you-have-and-more-precisely-how-many-devices-of-each-type-e-g-google-pixel-3-os-ver-10-do-you-have-how-is-the-allocation-of-these-devices-managed\">How many on-premise devices do you have, and more precisely, how many devices of each type (e.g. Google Pixel 3, OS ver. 10) do you have? How is the allocation of these devices managed?</h3><p>This site may answer your questions - <a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/device-tiers\">Devices tiers for Automate and App Automate</a>.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-run-mobile-app-tests-on-a-ci-setup\">How do you run mobile app tests on a CI setup?</h3><p>My current stack for running mobile app testing through CI consists of these tools - Jenkins, Maven, Java, Appium, and BrowserStack.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"what-kind-of-automation-test-should-we-run-nightly-and-what-s-the-success-rate-that-we-should-aim-for\">What kind of automation test should we run nightly, and what's the success rate that we should aim for?</h3><p>That depends on the context of your project and the risks of what not to check through (regression) are you willing to take. A good start is to create some sort of a smoke test set that covers the most critical scenarios of your app. The success rate, ideally, should be “all green” for all of them. 😉</p><p></p><h3 id=\"could-you-recommend-some-best-practices-for-load-testing-and-performance-testing\">Could you recommend some best practices for load testing and performance testing?</h3><p>Have a look here - <a href=\"https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-performance-testing-load-testing-stress-testing/\">Performance Testing vs Load Testing vs Stress Testing</a> </p><p></p><h3 id=\"are-there-any-specific-qa-communities-that-you-are-a-part-of-simon-and-could-you-recommend-some\">Are there any specific QA communities that you are a part of, Simon, and could you recommend some?</h3><p>I can highly recommend supporting the <a href=\"https://www.ministryoftesting.com/\">Ministry of Testing</a> community by joining their conferences, courses and buying a pro membership. The folks there and the community itself is very inclusive and supportive!</p>"

A few years ago, they started their business by developing an algorithm that placed them on top of the market straight away because of the massive improvements in terms of costs that clients were seeing when using their product. They inevitably started increasing the development team size as their impact on the market was getting bigger and bigger.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/05/5b01fd4a-5191-4925-9345-0fce46f8bd45.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"[Series] Better logs for a complex system\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/5b01fd4a-5191-4925-9345-0fce46f8bd45.jpeg 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/5b01fd4a-5191-4925-9345-0fce46f8bd45.jpeg 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/05/5b01fd4a-5191-4925-9345-0fce46f8bd45.jpeg 1043w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/@tiger-lily?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels\"><em>Tiger Lily</em></a><em> from </em><a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/warehouse-with-concrete-floor-4483609/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels\"><em>Pexels</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>At some point a few months after the small 5 people startup had become a 150 employees company, the head of development, Victor S, left the company, following a very interesting offer from a big company. The engineer in question was actually part of the 5 initial members and is the one that developed the core of the system, containing the principal algorithm that gave <em>Binary Packed</em> their major success at the very start.</p><p>Although, the success was so fast that the engineers from this company never considered implementing a logging system for their application as they were overwhelmed by feature requests from customers. But one day, someone made some changes to the core project and a few hours after being released, the support team drowned under calls and tickets from unhappy customers that were now about to send half empty trucks on the road since they updated their application. The first measure was obviously to revert to the previous patch, but then the nightmare began for the developers.</p><p>After weeks of debugging, they couldn’t understand why the issue was happening without having a proper logs system in place. They couldn’t even locate the issue. The release got delayed and therefore, the issue gradually escalated to higher levels, and at some point, the CTO of the company. For him, two solutions were there, either drop that feature completely or suck the shame in and call back Victor for help. Product wouldn’t let the feature be dropped, as very important contracts were about to be signed based on that. Therefore, they didn’t have any choice and they called their former employee to the rescue. After a few days getting back in context, he found the issue: a corner case that was not taken into account by the new engineer responsible for the core project.</p><p>That story tells us a little about how logs would have helped <em>Binary Packed</em> to locate the issue and fix it faster, they had the option of rolling back the previous patch to avoid customers to suffer too much from the error, and they were lucky the former employee that left the company with all the context was keen to help them. They get away with a bit of shame and a moral debt to Victor, but that could have been way worse.</p><p><strong>Study case #2: Locked Out</strong></p><p>For our second study case, we’re going talk about a security company: <em>Locked Out</em>, that specialised in account protection and password management. They offer their services to customers that want their accounts protected—e-mail inboxes, social media accounts, etc.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/05/7751b4bf-69b8-43b5-9076-6f090c67587e.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"[Series] Better logs for a complex system\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/7751b4bf-69b8-43b5-9076-6f090c67587e.jpeg 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/7751b4bf-69b8-43b5-9076-6f090c67587e.jpeg 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/05/7751b4bf-69b8-43b5-9076-6f090c67587e.jpeg 1043w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/@pixabay\"><em><u>Pixabay</u></em></a><em> from </em><a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/warehouse-with-concrete-floor-4483609/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels\"><em>Pexels</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Like any fast growing software company, especially in security, <em>Locked Out</em> quickly attracted people, most of them are genuine customers but some individuals had plans to take advantage of their success to make their own name as “hackers”.</p><p>The first of many attacks happened a few years after the official launch of the social media protection software, the most popular product of the <em>Locked Out</em> suite. The hackers silently targeted the entire company’s system using some code injection and altering the databases little by little, a bit more every attack. After a month, the attackers had gained complete access to the system, without anyone noticing it.</p><p>They stayed calm for months, letting the company grow until one day, they decided to launch their final attack. They revealed thousands of customers emails that were supposed to be securely protected. <em>Locked Out</em> engineers started investigating, of course, but they didn’t know what to look for as for them, everything was going well.</p><p>The peculiarity here is that the team never implemented any logs for their database module. The exact point where they got attacked. As a security company, they thought they wouldn’t need to debug anything at that level, that they would catch any intrusion way before that. They were wrong. After this incident, they reviewed their code and found out that they were exposed to code injection in one specific form on their main software. They rapidly fixed the issue and performed a reset of their databases to get rid of the attackers’ back door.</p><p>Having logs in place wouldn’t have protected them from the few first attacks, but they could potentially have detected them earlier and stopped the attackers before they gained complete access to the system.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>What the little stories we just went through together can teach us is that logs are more than a “nice-to-have”. You might not need them most of the time as realistically everything that goes in production doesn’t contain issues. But they can be a real lifesaver when it happens, so as a conclusion I would say: Invest time in your logs to avoid losing worse in the long run.</p><p><em>*The stories presented here are purely fictional and outlined for illustrational purposes only.

Some of the following will be easier to follow if the application is already up and running, and some are easier if you’re starting from scratch, but not being easy doesn’t mean less important, quite the opposite actually. The first 5 rules are, in my opinion, extremely important to follow where the last two are more like a nice-to-have.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/05/6384f561-8a7e-4652-8fd8-47285df8ebad.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"[Series] Better logs for a complex system\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/6384f561-8a7e-4652-8fd8-47285df8ebad.jpeg 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/6384f561-8a7e-4652-8fd8-47285df8ebad.jpeg 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/05/6384f561-8a7e-4652-8fd8-47285df8ebad.jpeg 1043w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/@geri-art-3439060\"><em><u>Geri Art</u></em></a><em> from </em><a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/warehouse-with-concrete-floor-4483609/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels\"><em>Pexels</em></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>I. One format to rule them all</strong></p><p>It is very important to use a consistent format across your entire application. That way, <strong>anyone</strong> can understand <strong>anything</strong> logged <strong>anywhere</strong> in the application. You wouldn’t write a part of your logs in English and another part in Spanish, so why would you use different formats throughout your entire application?<br><br>That assertion implies that the format needs to be very generic. But to be understood by people reading them, the logs also need to be specific enough so they make sense. That’s why defining the format, and more precisely the fields contained in each log line is key here.</p><p>The format is a matter of personal preferences coupled with what’s supported by the logging system you will use to centralise the logs. It needs to be readable for humans, as they will likely be the ones reading them the most but it also needs to be readable for programs (aka parsable). For those reasons I personally tend to choose JSON, but you can pick any format you want as long as it respects the previous assertion: <strong>readable</strong> and <strong>parsable</strong>.</p><p>If you’ve been working on your application for a while, debugging here and there, you probably have a clear idea of what fields you need. It will require a lot more reflection if you're designing it from scratch, although brainstorming on the log format will open quite a few discussions about the application design itself, which is always good to have sooner than later, before the tech debt starts piling up.</p><p>The aim of the fields is to add more data (or meta-data) to a simple message and help it to make sense. For that matter you want to look at the following indicators:</p><p>You need to be able to locate the part of the code that a line is about pretty easily. For that, you will want to add fields like <em>component</em>, <em>service</em>, <em>sub-component</em>, … — depending on your architecture — That will help you understand where the subject of the logs is executed. You should also consider adding the filename and the line number at which the log got written.</p><p>One way to know if you need an extra field is to ask yourself the following question: “Can the same line get written twice for two different reasons?” If the answer is yes, then you probably need an extra field. One good example for that is if you’re using threads, you might want to add the thread ID as a field to be able to track 2 different executions of the same process in parallel. The same would apply if your application is going to run over a cluster of machines i.e. adding the IP or hostname in a field might be a good idea.</p><p>Always add a timestamp to each log line. It will make your life a thousand times easier when you have to read through all the logs. Especially if multiple components are writing to a single file in parallel, the lines can get out of order pretty quickly. With a timestamp field, your central log system will be able to put them in the right order for you.</p><p><strong>II. Use severity levels accurately</strong></p><p>Severity levels are key when it comes to understanding the flow of your system, whether you’re monitoring it or debugging an issue. By using them, you provide a much more <strong>granular view of the execution</strong> of your program to whoever is reading the logs.</p><p>The most common levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL. They each determine, or at least help to determine, the actions required following an event being logged.</p><p>Here is an easy way of distinguishing the different levels:</p><p><strong>DEBUG</strong></p><p>Subject: Detailed execution of the operation not necessarily required to understand the flow.<br>What to do: Probably nothing.</p><p>Example: ”Appium server took 2.74 seconds to start”</p><p></p><p><strong>INFO</strong></p><p>Subject: Normal execution of the operation required to understand the flow of execution</p><p>What to do: Nothing.<br>Example: “Started Appium server for device 123456 on port 8085.”</p><p></p><p><strong>WARN</strong><br>Subject: Potential abnormal event that could lead to an error.</p><p>What to do: Debug before it becomes critical.</p><p>Example: “Timeout of 60s reached while starting Appium server. Retrying.”</p><p></p><p><strong>ERROR</strong><br>Subject: Abnormal event that prevents the operation from completing.<br>What to do: Debug in priority.<br>Example: “Could not start Appium server after 3 retries.“<br><br></p><p><strong>FATAL</strong><br>Subject: Unrecoverable error preventing the component/system execution.</p><p>What to do: Debug immediately.</p><p>Example: “No space left on disk.“</p><p></p><p>One interesting aspect of using severity levels is that they allow you to select a certain level of logs you want to push or not to your central log system. Define those “modes of execution” like Dev, Prod, Quarantine, … For example, in Prod mode you might want to retain the DEBUG level log lines on the machines but not push them in your central log system. That way you save space and also avoid unnecessary noise for anyone monitoring the system.</p><p><strong>III. Use context in your logs</strong></p><p>Each line of log should make sense <strong>on its own</strong> by containing the context of execution, either in the message itself or in separate fields. You should never have to read more than a handful of log lines to understand what’s going on and each of those lines should add to the whole description of your application’s execution.</p><p>Always prefer <strong>descriptive</strong> verbs to meaningless keywords. It makes things more natural to read and help whoever is monitoring to understand quickly what the application is/was doing at that time.</p><p><em>e.g. “Login failed” VS “User XYZ failed to login to service ABC” (user and service could also be separate fields here if it make sense for you)</em></p><p><strong>IV. Optimise your logging</strong></p><p>This rule might be the harder to apply properly, finding the right <strong>balance</strong> of logging takes time.</p><p>Too many logs would result in a noisy pile of text in front of your eyes, hard to make any sense of.</p><p>Too few would make the information delivered by them not accurate enough to do something with it or even inaccurate in some cases, leading you in the wrong path.</p><p>Also keep in mind that logging in an <strong>IO operation</strong>, which is expensive. You should therefore try to avoid logging the same information multiple times. For example, there is no need to rescue an error, log its message and re-raise the same error. A common good pattern here would be doing “error refinement”: rescue the error, log the error’s message and stack trace and raise a new error, more specific to your context. Although, you don’t want to be using this pattern all the time, most of the cases it would be better to stick to the original error and log it whenever you rescue it at higher levels so you preserve the original context of the error: stack trace, message, etc. Again, it is a matter of what suits your needs.</p><p><strong>V. Do not log sensitive data</strong></p><p>Even if your logs are likely not publicly accessible, they are often consolidated in a central system, sometimes operated by a third party. Even if they’re stored in-house, it’s pretty common to spend less effort on protecting the log system than a production database for example.</p><p>For that reason, you need to be aware to not log <strong>sensitive data</strong> such as passwords, public IPs or URLs and keep an eye open for them when you’re reviewing your team’s code. By doing so, you’re protecting yourself against an escalation of a potential attack: If someone somehow gain access to your central log system and start reading/parsing through your logs, they won’t be able to go any further using info from your own logs such as a public API and the keys to access it logged in the same message.</p><p>One pretty common way of implementing this rule is to integrate <strong>redaction hooks</strong> in your logger, that would parse your logs looking for potentially sensitive data and replace them with a nice and neat <em>[REDACTED]</em>. That way, if you miss some sensitive data during review, it will still get protected afterwards.</p><p><strong>VI. Use logs as part of your metric system</strong></p><p>You can, and should integrate your logs as <strong>part of your metric system</strong>. It doesn’t replace a proper alerting system but can easily complete it and it is usually made easy by CLS solutions to do so.</p><p>If you followed the previous 5 rules, you have most of the data about your system execution, you know for sure that the information in your logs is accurate, non redundant and divided across different severity levels.</p><p>You can then take advantage of that by <strong>identifying trends</strong> in your logs. For example you can count the number of logs under the severity “WARN” and use this to detect an increase in the number of warnings, probably meaning that your system is about to crash or, if you have all the fallbacks in place, taking up more resources than needed.</p><p>You can use all the fields you created to group the logs and define more specific metrics you want to monitor the trend, for example count the number of ERROR messages for a given component that is critical for your system. You shouldn’t, however, go as far as parsing the content of the logs to find for example durations and things like that. Those should be pushed separately in your metric system.</p><p><strong>VII. Writing logs shouldn’t slow down or hang up system execution</strong></p><p>As mentioned in the fourth rule of this article, logging in an expensive operation and takes up time and resources. However, it is not something that is part of your application on the same level as your core component. It isn’t less important, but it shouldn’t be taking resources from it.</p><p>By logging synchronously, i.e. writing directly to a file within your code, you are gonna be <strong>waiting</strong> for this write operation to be completed and the rest of your execution will be delayed, every single time you’re writing a log line. But there are many things that comes into play here when you write to a file: opening the file, creating it if it doesn’t exists, waiting on the file to be available in case multiple processes write to it, etc.</p><p>All those can be taken care of by creating your own library around your logging (or use a prebuilt one if it suits your needs) but all those checks will again add to the delay created by your logs. To avoid this, you can try and aim to log <strong>asynchronously</strong>. By modifying your library, you can make it deal with all the logs in parallel of your main application’s execution, by making use of a message queue for example.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>By following the 7 rules defined in this article, I believe you can make the best out of your new logging framework and perhaps catch production issues, or even attacks, quickly and easily.</p><p>In this article, I’ve been referring a lot to a “Central Log System” (CLS). Although it’s pretty much self-explanatory, that part of the work has been left aside voluntarily to not interfere with the definition of the log framework itself.</p><p>In my next article, I’m gonna walk you through the decision we made here at BrowserStack to implement our central log system based on the stack named EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana). </p><p>Stay tuned!</p>"

Observability helps in understanding what is happening on the inside of the system just by leveraging the external indicators.</p><h3 id=\"need-for-observability\">Need for observability</h3><p>The main goal for every company is to be successful by generating revenue and gaining customers.  In order to gain customers, the software application should be reliable and scalable. In an ideal world, the company would constantly keep growing because the software application continues to be reliable and always scales well. However, in reality, unexpected scenarios do happen.</p><p>During such a scenario, an on-call engineer has to act fast and resolve it. Usually, the engineer is flooded with questions to figure out what is happening. The questions to be answered would be identifying the duration of the failure, type of failure, affected customers, and time to uptime. This is where observability provides visibility into the system. It is a gateway for handling known and unknown situations.</p><p>Now, the observability becomes an important characteristic of the software system just like reliability and scalability. As a result, the system is scalable from not only from the technology aspect but also from engineer productivity aspect. With observability, one can identify potential bottlenecks and areas of optimization. Thus, leading to a performant system and lesser failures.</p><h3 id=\"pillars-of-observability\">Pillars of Observability</h3><p>The three popular pillars of observability are: Metrics, Tracing and Logs.</p><p><strong>Metrics</strong></p><p>Metrics help in measuring the system quantitatively. Everything in the system is measurable. But the key lies in identifying what to measure. Since metrics are the foundation of trend analysis and alerting, it is important to identify the critical metrics.  Hence, metrics are the golden signals that provide insight into the system.</p><p>Types of Metrics:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.04.28-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Observability in Selenium\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.04.28-PM.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.04.28-PM.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.04.28-PM.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.04.28-PM.png 1718w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Metrics can be classified broadly into two categories—Measurement and Distribution.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>There is no standardization in the terms used in this section. The key is understanding the underlying concepts.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p></p><p><strong>Measurement</strong></p><p>Measurement metrics are the simplest and most basic types of metrics. They provide accurate measurement values.</p><p><u>Counter</u></p><p>As the name suggests, it is used to count. It is an additive measure since it adds to or subtracts from a base value.  Usually, counters are monotonically increasing or decreasing but sometimes they can be both. Monotonically increasing means the value either remains the same or increases but does not decrease.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>Total no. of users</li><li>Successful/ Failed requests</li><li>No. of open-connections</li></ul><p><u>Gauge</u></p><p>Gauge is a value at that instant of time. A simple example of the gauge is a thermometer, it shows the temperature at that instant. Since gauge does not add to a base value, it is a non-additive metric.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>Current no. of threads</li><li>Current memory usage</li><li>Queue size</li></ul><p><strong>Distribution</strong></p><p>Distribution type metrics are complex in nature. They provide an approximate representation of the underlying metrics data.</p><p><u>Histogram</u></p><p>Histogram metrics represent the distribution of data. It primarily provides quantile and percentile value. In order to understand this further let’s quickly revisit a simple median calculation. Consider a set of 9 numbers, in order to calculate the median we first sort the numbers and pick the middle element i.e the 5<sup>th </sup>element. This number is the median or 50<sup>th</sup> percentile, which means that 50% numbers are below the median and 50% numbers are above the median value. Similarly, for 99<sup>th</sup> percentile, 99% of the value are below that value.</p><p>It is easy to calculate these values for a small set of numbers, but with the time-series nature of metrics, the data explodes into million data points easily and to sort and store them to get percentile values is not practical. Hence, the data is sampled to represent the underlying data approximately and the values are calculated over a sliding window of a time-period (Ex: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes).</p><p>Values like 99<sup>th</sup> percentile are used to identify the outlier values and this is important to make engineering decisions. Example, for an on-call engineer it would important to know that the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile request latency for the application went from 10ms to 50ms in the last 10 minutes than knowing the actual values per millisecond. It depicts the shift in the whole data distribution.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>CPU usage</li><li>Request latency</li></ul><p><u>Meter</u></p><p>It is a rate metric. One common example is the number of requests handled per second. Meter is sometimes included as part of the histogram. Knowing the rate for each second is not very useful, hence aggregation over this data adds value. A common aggregation would be average. Again, the average calculated over a sliding window of time is more useful than the average calculated from the time the application started. Average filters out the noisy data. Hence a weighted average is a better aggregate. Ideally with more weight given to the recent data or more weight given to the higher values will keep the shape of the graph intact to identify peaks and dips.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>No. of requests per second</li><li>Error count per 5 minutes window</li></ul><h3 id=\"logs-and-event-logs\">Logs and Event logs</h3><p>Logging is identifying important points in the code and recording the information at the instant. It also involves identifying the logging level to be used based on the information recorded. Logging is often done in a human-readable format or structured format for machines to analyze and search over it. Logs are key for debugging and simulating IDE debug feature when code is running in production.</p><p>A simple log example :</p><p>16:27:57.042 INFO [LoggingOptions.getTracer] - Using OpenTelemetry for tracing</p><p><code><em>1</em>16:27:57.042 INFO [LoggingOptions.getTracer] - Using OpenTelemetry for tracing</code></p><p>Structured logging is a common practice of recording logs consistently in a fixed format. It commonly contains fields like:</p><ol><li>Timestamp</li><li>Logging level</li><li>Logger class</li><li>Log message (This is further broken down into fields relevant to the operation where the log was recorded)</li></ol><p>A structured log is the same as a simple log but with key-value pairs, where the keys are fixed fields.</p><p><code><em>1</em>{\"class\": \"LoggingOptions\", <em>2</em>\"log-level\": \"INFO\", <em>3</em>\"log-message\": \"Using OpenTelemetry for tracing\", <em>4</em>\"log-name\": \"org.openqa.selenium.grid.log.LoggingOptions\", <em>5</em>\"log-time-local\": \"2020-11-12T16:27:57.042+05:30\", <em>6</em>\"log-time-utc\": \"2020-11-12T10:57:57.042Z\", <em>7</em>\"method\": \"getTracer\"} <em>89</em></code></p><p>However, there is a better way to look at logs. Think of important operations in your code as events. Each event can record all the context of the event as a log. So each step in the application workflow should have event-logs that provide all the answers about that step. It can include the inputs, outputs, results, error details, and/or important attributes collected along the way. Pretty much whatever information is available and can help debug should be included in an event log. Event-logs like all structured logs have fix fields but the fields can have variable nested fields to encapsulate the context.  Observe the two-event logs below, at first sight, they seem like structured-logs but the event-logs are from Selenium 4.0.0 Alpha 7 capturing context to for a specific operation.</p><p><code><em>1</em>16:34:34.136 INFO [LoggingOptions$1.lambda$export$0] - { <em>2</em>  \"traceId\": \"a9a9a87f0be04eec6ca4fed26b77274f\", <em>3</em>  \"spanId\": \"534e81ac65fe1c20\", <em>4</em>  \"spanKind\": \"INTERNAL\", <em>5</em>  \"eventTime\": 1605179071797141816, <em>6</em>  \"eventName\": \"Session request received by the distributor\", <em>7</em>  \"attributes\": { <em>8</em>    \"logger\": \"org.openqa.selenium.grid.distributor.local.LocalDistributor\", <em>9</em>    \"request.payload\": \"{\\n  \\\"desiredCapabilities\\\": {\\n    \\\"browserName\\\": \\\"chrome\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"capabilities\\\": {\\n    \\\"firstMatch\\\": [\\n      {\\n        \\\"browserName\\\": \\\"chrome\\\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n}\" <em>10</em>  } <em>11</em>} <em>1</em>16:34:34.132 INFO [LoggingOptions$1.lambda$export$0] - { <em>2</em>  \"traceId\": \"a9a9a87f0be04eec6ca4fed26b77274f\", <em>3</em>  \"spanId\": \"8f55a7dbdff8f03a\", <em>4</em>  \"spanKind\": \"INTERNAL\", <em>5</em>  \"eventTime\": 1605179074130876199, <em>6</em>  \"eventName\": \"Added session into local session map\", <em>7</em>  \"attributes\": { <em>8</em>    \"logger\": \"org.openqa.selenium.grid.sessionmap.local.LocalSessionMap\", <em>9</em>    \"session.id\": \"49da51d92257d7466dd178341403b87e\" <em>10</em>  } <em>11</em>}</code></p><h3 id=\"tracing\">Tracing</h3><p>Earlier applications were monolithic in nature and all components were tightly coupled. It was easier to trace a request. But in the advent of microservices architecture, a single request or transaction spans multiple services and components. Hence tracing becomes crucial. Tracing tracks the request lifecycle as each service executes the request. It is useful in debugging in an error scenario. Some key terms used in tracing context are:</p><p><strong>Trace</strong> </p><p>Tracing allows tracing a request through multiple services, starting from its origin to its final destination. This request's journey helps in debugging, monitoring the end-to-end flow and identifying failures. A trace depicts the end-to-end request flow. Since each request is unique, each trace is unique. To identify a trace a unique trace id is used.</p><p><strong>Span</strong> </p><p>Each trace is made up of timed operations called spans. A span has a start and end time and it represents operations done by a service. The length of the span depends on the operation length. Each span has a unique identifier. All spans within a trace share the same trace id.</p><p><strong>Span Attributes</strong> </p><p>Span attributes are key-value pairs which provide additional information about each span.</p><p><strong>Events</strong> </p><p>Events are timed-stamped logs within a span. They provide additional context to the existing spans. Events also contain key-value pairs as event attributes.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-6.47.05-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Observability in Selenium\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-6.47.05-PM.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-6.47.05-PM.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-6.47.05-PM.png 1492w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In the image above, the entire request journey is a trace. A request will do important operations along the way like a database call, store information in a cache and then search a query. These operations are spans. Making a trace collection of spans.</p><p>Within each operation, there might nested operations (child spans). The search service will have child spans for encoding/decoding step and query parsing.</p><p>For each span, span attributes containing the context can be added. For a database call, one can record the database name, host and port, database query and the result. If the result failed, the event can capture the time of the error along with error details.</p><h3 id=\"observability-pipeline\"><br>Observability Pipeline</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-6.15.44-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Observability in Selenium\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-6.15.44-PM.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-6.15.44-PM.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-6.15.44-PM.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-6.15.44-PM.png 2120w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>So far, we have covered the instrumentation part of the observability workflow. Making a system observable by instrumenting code is not enough to reap the benefits. Additional components are required as follows:</p><ol><li>Reporter - Suppose the metrics are recorded every millisecond but we want it reported every second. Then the data collected has to be aggregated and flushed out of the system. This work is done by the reporter. The reporter can also flush out and write logs and traces. Reporter prevents the filling up the memory with metrics data.</li><li>Pipeline - Think of the pipeline as the staging area for the metrics. A pipeline would typically have the producer(reporter) and a consumer (something that writes to the database). Both the producer and the consumer would be independent of each other. One might think that reporter can directly write to the database, but this will not scale well in an error scenario. Consider a scenario where the database is handling heavy-weight queries and as a result, the data ingestion is slow or paused. At this time, the mechanisms for retries and back-pressure can be implemented while consuming from the pipeline.  The pipeline is capable of storing high volume data for a longer duration. The reporter storing high volume metrics will impact the service and result in out-of-memory exceptions.</li></ol><p>Storage - This includes :</p><ol><li>A database specialized in storing time-series database for metrics</li><li>A storage mechanism specialized in indexing and searching logs.</li><li>A storage mechanism specialized in correlating traces and allowing search on traces.</li><li>Visualization - This includes visualization tools for metrics to create dashboards for various scenarios is a must and trace visualization tools for correlating traces along a timeline.</li><li>Alerting - A component that allows setting thresholds for metrics and fires alerts to various channels of communication.</li></ol><h3 id=\"selenium-observability\">Selenium Observability</h3><p>Selenium 4.0.0 Alpha 7 Grid leverages OpenTelemetry to instrument traces and event-logs. Every new request has its own trace and important operations in the workflow are covered using spans and events.</p><p>The traces can be visualized using Jaeger.  OpenTelemetry provides the APIs and SDKs to instrument traces in the code. Whereas Jaeger is a tracing backend, that aids in collecting the tracing telemetry data and providing querying, filtering and visualizing features for the data. Jaeger can be easily configured with Grid to visualize traces.</p><p>Traces and event-logs will allow Selenium Grid users to identify how well the requests are performing on their infrastructure. This aids in identifying potential bottlenecks and performance improvement.</p><p>Refer to <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/pujagani/14bec3303410af8477f7320c5cdcc365\">Selenium Grid Observability</a>.</p><h3 id=\"popular-tools\">Popular Tools</h3><p>A plethora of tools and resources available of tools and resources are available to get started with observability or to enhance existing observability stack.

We also contributed code to key parts like the Observability features, collaborated on supported languages in Selenium Client bindings, and our interns built the first version of the new Selenium Grid UI while improving the GraphQL support.\"<br><br><strong>David Burns, Head of Open Source at BrowserStack and Core Contributor to Selenium</strong></blockquote><p>Selenium 4's new features allow users to write tests with a fresh perspective, by tapping into the back end of the browser.</p><p>Some of the new Selenium 4 features that BrowserStack Automate supports include:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Relative Locators:</strong></strong> Write simpler and more stable tests. Select page elements based on their relative location to another. The relative locators added are <em><em>above</em></em>, <em><em>below</em></em>, <em><em>toLeftOf</em></em>, <em><em>toRightOf</em></em> and <em><em>near</em></em>.</li><li><strong><strong>Network Interception: </strong></strong>Intercept, validate and modify network requests and responses. Add additional headers, fail requests, modify the request/response body and more.</li><li><strong><strong>Listen to JS Exceptions and Console Logs:</strong></strong> Monitor the browser console logs and watch for JS exceptions. Register callbacks to process events and exceptions.</li><li><strong><strong>And much more: </strong></strong>Automate also supports other Selenium 4 features like Basic Auth, Network Simulation, Mocking Geolocation and Device Mode Simulation</li></ul><p>Want to try it for yourself?

The plan should cover all aspects of the transformation journey and guide teams to move ahead in the transformation process. <strong> </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this stage, it is essential to ensure that the goals and objectives of the transformation are communicated across the organisation; teams should be assured of management support in the challenges ahead, and transparency across teams. Securing and gaining trust from individuals is critical for the success of the DevOps transformation process as it considerably reduces the chances of resistance<strong>. </strong></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Establish DevOps Centre of Excellence (DCoE)</strong></h3>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.testingxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Establish-DevOps-Centre-of-ExcellenceCoE.jpg\" alt=\"DevOps Excellence\" width=\"351\" height=\"351\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20315\" /></center></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">DevOps Centre of Excellence (DCoE) is a shared platform where DevOps practitioners share their experiences and learn from each other. The DevOps CoE must include representatives from all delivery teams and vendor organisations. It should be led by an enterprise leader who has support from all levels in the organisation. It is preferred to have an experienced external partner to conduct the initial phases of CoE. This DevOps transformation takes a time of 12-24 months to ensure the complete transition.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Build a culture of learning and collaboration in the enterprise</strong></h3>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.testingxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Build-a-culture-of-learning-and-collaboration-in-the-enterprise.jpg\" alt=\"enterprise devops transformation \" width=\"351\" height=\"351\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20317\" /></center></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">DevOps brings a change in the business processes, and the organisational culture is more prone to resistance from employees. This sudden change can also cause some temporary strain to some parts of the business. Still, it can effectively be addressed by building a culture of inclusion, boosting the morale of individuals &amp; teams, and ensuring collaboration between teams. It is more likely that with agile and DevOps transformation, practitioner&#8217;s roles and responsibilities will change. Thus, teams should be provided with an ideal organisational culture and learning environment that empowers them and fosters a collaborative environment. However, businesses must note that cultural change has to happen from the top down.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Set up DevOps KPIs and governing mechanism </strong></h3>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.testingxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Set-up-DevOps-KPIs-and-governing-mechanism.jpg\" alt=\"DevOps KPIs\" width=\"351\" height=\"351\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20318\" /></center></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this stage, organisation must streamline their business processes, align communication channels to achieve successful DevOps transformation. Enterprises must establish DevOps Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to govern the culture of the enterprise.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The organisational culture typically needs effective governance, and this is where governing principles come into the picture. Governing principles or DevOps KPIs ensures safe and effective DevOps transformation. Enterprises must set the roles and responsibilities of DevOps practitioners, share awareness about team collaboration to empower teams.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Conduct workshops for scrum teams </strong></h3>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.testingxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Conduct-workshops-for-scrum-teams-04.jpg\" alt=\"devops scrum teams\" width=\"351\" height=\"351\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20319\" /></center></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This step plays a vital role in the DevOps transformation journey. It is essential to conduct workshops for the scrum teams with the help of subject matter experts (SMEs) to ensure the right sizing of tools and processes. At this stage, enterprises must look at their existing tools and technologies to identify which tools will work for the organisation, and action can be taken accordingly. Further, this step also ensures that selecting tools, accelerators, and methods is more purposeful and help teams realize the DevOps goals. As the DevOps process moves, the intake process can be altered based on the need and further evolved according to the needs and feedback from experts.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6. Run the pilot program and compare results with KPIs</strong></h3>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.testingxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Run-the-pilot-program-and-compare-results-with-KPIs-06.jpg\" alt=\"Devbops Services\" width=\"351\" height=\"351\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20320\" /></center></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this stage, the DevOps practitioners identify the right applications and domains to apply DevOps practices.

Improves response time:</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Response time is the total time taken by the software to generate an output against the input received. Typically, this testing method helps to <strong>improve the app’s response time</strong> by removing performance-related issues from the software.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. Enhances the load time: </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is known that slow-loading websites annoy customers, and similar is the case with mobile apps having more load time, users either abandon the app or move to the nearest competitor. Typically, this testing method improves the loading time of applications by identifying and removing performance and load-related issues or bugs from the software.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Improves scalability: </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The scalability of an app refers to its capacity to handle varying user loads seamlessly. This test helps in enhancing the load handling capacity of apps by testing the apps and websites under varying user loads.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Eliminates bottlenecks: </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bottlenecks are the barriers that decrease the responsiveness of the entire system. This <strong><a href=\"https://www.testingxperts.com/blog/performance-testing-guide/#What-are-the-Different-Types-of-Performance-Testing?\">performance testing method</a></strong> helps to find performance bottlenecks in the software by identifying the areas that cause the problems and helps to fix them by notifying the dev team promptly.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>5. Helps in early identification and fixing of defects:</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Performance testing allows testers to detect and fix performance-related issues faster and frequently. It enables testers to quickly identify issues and helps in faster resolution of bugs.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>6. Speeds up the testing process: </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the earlier software development models like the waterfall model, the testers had to wait for the development process to get over to start the software testing. But in an agile environment, performance testing is integrated along with the development process, which speeds up the overall software testing process. Typically, a shift-left method of testing is followed in parallel to development which ensures faster results.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>7. Enhances Customer Experience (CX): </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Performance testing ensures delivery of high-quality products to customers in less time.

Nakul built the website in two days, but things got out of hand when Ritesh had to test it. The website had to be tested for compatibility across different devices, operating systems, and browsers—it was a tedious process and was slowing them down, as always.</p><p>They decided to take a quick look at the market to understand the problem better, and they found out that they were not alone. The struggle with cross-compatibility testing was universal.</p><p>This realization gave birth to BrowserStack. It's been ten years since then, and a lot has changed.</p><p>What remains the same is our product-first approach. A lot of the love we receive from the developer community is because of our world-class products that solve real problems, and they’ve been our biggest growth driver. We started by launching support for just Internet Explorer, added cross-browser testing on desktop and mobile, launched automated testing for websites and apps, and automated visual testing—all in a single cloud platform.</p><p>BrowserStack has grown exponentially and continues to do so—right from getting the first 1000 paid customers in 2012, acquiring Percy in 2020, to closing the $200 million Series B funding at a $4 billion valuation a few months ago. Today, over 50,000+ teams rely on BrowserStack to ship bug-free software.</p><p>But these milestones only guide BrowserStack—they don't define us.</p><p>We're defined by our people—their highs and lows, their wins, both big and small, their persistence, and dedication to a shared vision. Our core principles of solving real problems and being customer-obsessed drive everything we do at BrowserStack. We believe by building trust and being open and respectful of one another, we can move mountains. We'd like to thank our people—it's their spirit to achieve that has got us this far and will continue to take us places.</p><p>BrowserStack's future is one of rapid growth and scale. Software is shaping lives globally, and our products massively impact the quality of software.</p><p>BrowserStack turns ten today, and to mark this milestone, we pledge to 10x our commitment to the vision of becoming the testing infrastructure for the internet.</p>"

To do this, they have to adopt DevOps, test more, and test fast. However, for most companies, testing remains the key bottleneck in the DevOps cycle. Our goal is to simplify testing for developers and enable them to build and ship bug-free software for the 5 billion internet users around the world. <br><br>BrowserStack was founded in 2011 at a coffee shop to solve one problem—testing on different browsers, leading to BrowserStack’s first version, which helped developers test their websites on Internet Explorer 11 (IE11).</p><p>Ten years later, we've grown to 50,000+ customers across 135 countries with four million developers signups—what remains the same is our developer-first approach to building world-class products. <br><br>We're grateful for our investors who believed in our vision and bring their expertise in helping deep-tech companies scale and grow. The funding will help us accelerate product innovation, aid strategic acquisitions, and scale our Product and Engineering teams. <br><br>We’re committed to our vision of becoming the testing infrastructure of the internet, which opens up infinite possibilities of empowering developers to build amazing experiences.

Deploy previews are convenient for reviewers because they can leave high-quality feedback right from the preview, and it’s easier for developers because every review gets automatically synced to the GitHub pull request or productivity tools like Clubhouse.io, Linear, or Trello.</p><p>Since there are so many helpful features stuffed into Deploy Previews, we wanted to stop and take a moment to spotlight one of our favorites: the View on BrowserStack, which makes it easy for developers to reproduce a reviewer’s browser environment with just one click. If you’re new to <a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/\">BrowserStack</a>, it is a cloud platform for testing on 2,000+ real browsers and devices that is used by <a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/200-million-series-b-funding/\">four million developers around the world.</a></p><h2 id=\"netlify-and-browserstack-partnering-for-a-better-developer-experience\">Netlify and BrowserStack: Partnering for a better developer experience</h2><p>When we <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/05/19/next-generation-deploy-previews-plus-netlify-acquires-featurepeek/?__hstc=76629258.6025d2b8451ee63d16239505f4cb33e8.1626756812146.1626756812146.1626769979638.2&amp;__hssc=76629258.1.1626769979638&amp;__hsfp=3032473782\">introduced collaborative Deploy Previews</a> in May, we included a feature that uses browser metadata to reproduce reviewers’ browser environments.

As Covid-19 hit, companies were forced to rethink strategies and processes to adapt to uncertainty. Teams were asked to work from home, upending everything we knew about traditional workplaces.</p><p>BrowserStack, too, is evolving and embracing this shift. Starting today, BrowserStack will be remote-first. Our colleagues will have the flexibility to work from anywhere and the freedom to be more present where it matters the most—personal life, family, downtime, or whatever they choose. There will be planned travel to the base location so teams can innovate, interact and build camaraderie.</p><p>Pandemic or not, the health and wellbeing of our people are of utmost importance to us—and what we've learned from their resilience during these challenging times is that they're happier and more efficient when given the option to work from a location of their choice. This way, they work on their own schedule to deliver impactful work giving them more autonomy to plan time around their lives and not the other way around.</p><p>Another upside to going remote-first is it throws open a global talent pool to help us on our mission of empowering developers to build amazing experiences.

With this integration, users can run Puppeteer and Playwright tests at scale on over 100 browser versions.</p><p>Both Puppeteer and Playwright have taken a fresh approach to test automation, removing the need for external drivers and controlling browsers directly via an API. This has opened up new possibilities for users in both test performance and functionality.</p><p>As developer-friendly automation tools, Puppeteer and Playwright have helped teams to adopt a Shift-Left approach to testing. These teams run a high volume of tests on a regular basis, underscoring the need for fast, scalable and reliable test infrastructure. Teams that can't rely on their infrastructure end up skipping tests and lowering device/browser coverage, but at the the risk of delivering buggy experiences to end-users. BrowserStack empowers teams to focus on testing - not test infrastructure - so they can ship faster, and deliver a bug-free experience for every user.</p><p>BrowserStack is committed to integrating emerging tools and frameworks which developers love. We added support for Cypress last year, and are looking forward to adding more integrations in the coming months.</p><h3 id=\"key-features\">Key Features</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Browser and OS coverage:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Playwright: Multiple versions of vanilla Chrome and Edge, in addition to Playwright’s patched versions of Chromium, Webkit and Firefox.</li>\n<li>Puppeteer: Multiple versions Chrome, Firefox and Edge.</li>\n<li>Run tests on Windows 10 or macOS Mojave, Catalina and Big Sur for both frameworks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Parallelization:</strong> Run hundreds of tests in parallel on BrowserStack’s cloud grid for rapid test results.

Due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, businesses across the world have started shifting online. Though this sudden shift helped businesses to survive, it increased the level of competition among companies. And now, with the holiday season 2021 fast approaching, the competition among businesses is expected to grow more intense.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This year, the holiday shopping season, especially Black Friday and Cyber Monday, is likely to be different and bigger than all previous years.

According to Salesforce, global online sales during Cyber Week 2020 hit a new record with $270 billion, which was 36% higher as compared to the year 2019. The major driver behind this unexpected rise was the change in customers&#8217; shopping behaviour due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the reduced in-store holiday hours, consumers preferred online shopping during the cyber week that pushed digital sales to new heights.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, various challenges were faced by businesses during the holiday sales 2020, which negatively affected their revenues, brand image, and customer shopping experience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">• Issues with mobile app performance, such as frequent app crashes, server time-outs, delayed response etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">• Failure to provide a high-performing and secure interface for online shoppers</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">• Slow app loading due to heavy user load</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">• Difficulty in maintaining responsiveness of eCommerce websites</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">• Challenges in ensuring 24/7 uptime for POS applications</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">• Delay in processing payments</p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a style=\"position: relative; top: -80px;\" name=\"Role of Performance Testing for Holiday Readiness of Apps\"></a><strong>Role of Performance Testing for Holiday Readiness of Apps</strong></h1>\n<p><center><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-20656\" src=\"https://www.testingxperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Why-do-businesses-need-performance-testing.jpg\" alt=\"performance testing role for apps\" /></center></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Performance testing is a non-functional software testing type that evaluates the performance of apps under various conditions, such as varying bandwidth, increased user load, fluctuating networks, etc. The main aim of this test is to remove performance-related bottlenecks from apps. Therefore, by leveraging this non-functional software testing type, businesses can overcome the above-mentioned challenges and get the effective performance of apps during peak load days such as the festive season and holiday season.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are various benefits that businesses can reap by leveraging this non-functional software testing type.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Increases responsiveness of apps: </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is always preferred that if the responsiveness of apps is good, it ensures excellent user engagement. To ensure the high responsiveness of apps, performance testing is essential.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Improves loading time: </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Slow-loading websites usually annoy the customer, and they lose interest. Performance testing helps to improve the loading time taken by applications or websites.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Provides higher stability: </strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apps should not crash when the user load increases to ensure a great use experience (UX).

Here, our teams have to maintain confidence that their code works as intended, and indeed, our methodology is not based on “<em>Hope that everything works</em>”. </p><p>We help organizations, irrespective of their size, to deliver. To be able to do that, we have to be very critical about our delivery first. At the rate we push the code, doing anything manually will only hinder our engineer’s ability.</p><blockquote><br>“<em>It is beneath the dignity of excellent men to waste their time in the calculation when any peasant could do the work just as accurately with the aid of a machine</em>” </blockquote><p>- Gottfried Leibniz, 1694</p><p><br>We took that seriously. We don’t want to disrespect our engineers. So, we made sure none of our engineers will work on repetitive and menial tasks ever again, and a good CI/CD pipeline ensures just that. From testing out the code in different fashions to the final deployment, a well-designed CI/CD can help drastically reduce the time taken in each step and increase free time for our engineers to have fun.</p><p><br>Initially, when our teams were small, for CI/CD, we had multiple platforms for deployments based on use-cases.</p><p>We had a single <strong>m5.xlarge</strong> machine on <strong>AWS</strong> running <strong>Jenkins</strong> in a <strong>Docker</strong> container. The jobs were set up manually from the <strong>Jenkins UI</strong>. Another tool we use was <a href=\"https://github.com/zendesk/samson\">Samson</a> which was again set up on a standalone machine mostly used for application deploys. Apart from this, several other teams had set up their own <strong>Jenkins</strong> to cater to their needs.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Our journey to managing Jenkins on AWS EKS\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/1.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/1.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/1.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/1.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"blob:https://browserstack.atlassian.net/2bd3af31-d97c-4a30-8450-65066a7c55df#media-blob-url=true&amp;id=3a3e67de-40f2-4711-a0e2-378f67aa38df&amp;collection=contentId-3091137005&amp;contextId=3091137005&amp;mimeType=image%2Fpng&amp;name=image-20210727-133722.png&amp;size=43233&amp;width=292&amp;height=165\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Our journey to managing Jenkins on AWS EKS\"></figure><p>This used to work pretty well until a few months ago. As the company started to “<strong>Blitzscale</strong>”, the number of engineers in the team almost doubled, and so did the number of jobs run on these platforms.</p><p>We didn’t over-engineer our CI/CD processes to handle the scalability in the past. Informally speaking, in a scalable system, things should not get incrementally worse as we move from small to large. And there is only so much we can scale vertically. Vertical scaling will cost more, and even if cost-saving is not a priority, technology and equipment are still obviously limited by its time. So, it was time for us to scale horizontally.</p><p>A good scalable system has:</p><ul><li><strong>Size scalability</strong>: Adding more nodes should make the system linearly faster</li><li><strong>Administrative scalability</strong>: Adding more nodes should not increase the administrative costs</li><li><strong>Storage scalability</strong>: Adding more nodes should not increase the probability of data loss</li><li><strong>Availability</strong>: Adding more nodes should increase the availability of the system</li></ul><p></p><p>The issue with our setup was:</p><ul><li>The distributed nature of deploys used to create many issues in access management, tracking deploys, and an added overhead of maintenance of all these platforms.</li><li>Scalability was an issue as the resource requirement was going up, and these platforms were just being run on a single machine.</li><li>Single point of failure</li><li>Reproducibility - If the machine volume ever got corrupted, there was no way to recover the jobs and pipelines as they were set up manually and not maintained anywhere.</li></ul><p>More or less, it was becoming cumbersome to manage it manually through UI, and also, our anxiety was going through the roof due to the issues mentioned above.<br></p><h3 id=\"major-decisions\">Major decisions</h3><p>We wanted to engineer a distributed system for CI/CD to solve issues like scalability, single point of failure, maintenance, and growing team size.</p><p>In the past, we were aware of all the issues we were going to encounter, so to make the transition easier, we decided to set up Jenkins to run in a Docker container the past.</p><p>To automate scaling, deployment, and management of containers more efficiently, we have gone for <strong>Kubernetes</strong>. <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/\">Kubernetes</a>, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Instead of self-managed service, we have opted for managed service called <strong>AWS EKS - Elastic Kubernetes Service</strong> to further streamline the process. We plan on describing our AWS adventures further in a separate post.</p><p>Our entire stack already runs on AWS. So, choosing AWS EKS will ensure that all our services will work in tandem with low latency.</p><p>One more crucial decision to solve the growing team size is shifting configuring systems from UI to code. Shifting to <strong>Infrastructure as Code</strong> and <strong>Configuration as Code</strong> further streamlined our CI/CD process.</p><p></p><h3 id=\"managing-jobs-as-code\">Managing Jobs as Code</h3><p>When making Jenkins Infra as Code, its jobs should be deployed from code instead of creating jobs on Jenkins manually.</p><p>We have a <strong>Job Generator</strong> that reads groovy files and Jenkinsfile from our GitHub repo for easy management of jobs and creates these jobs on Jenkins.</p><p>The advantage of this is:</p><ul><li>The files can be committed to git, just like code</li><li>The audit becomes easy</li><li>Bugs can be tracked and fixed</li><li>Granting and revoking permissions for an individual is an edit away. More on this in “<strong>Access Management for Jobs”</strong> below.<br></li></ul><p>So any new job committed in the repo will be added to Jenkins, and any manual modification of jobs on Jenkins UI will be reverted to the original configuration. This also enables us to manage job structure in folders/list views for ease of use.</p><p><strong>Github repository structure:</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/directory-structure.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Our journey to managing Jenkins on AWS EKS\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/directory-structure.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/directory-structure.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/directory-structure.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/directory-structure.png 2092w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"access-management-for-jobs\">Access Management for jobs</h3><p>It is always advised to follow the “<strong>Principle of Least Privilege</strong>”, i.e., giving a person only essential privileges to perform their intended function. And Jenkins has ‘<strong>manage and assign role</strong>’ for providing access to different jobs to different individuals.</p><p>It's a matrix-like structure that becomes very difficult to manage from UI when roles and people grow in size. There is a high probability of giving wrong permissions to the wrong person.</p><p>This is how it’s looking in our “<strong>Blitzscale</strong>” phase:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-03-at-12.54.21-PM.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Our journey to managing Jenkins on AWS EKS\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-03-at-12.54.21-PM.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-03-at-12.54.21-PM.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-03-at-12.54.21-PM.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/Screenshot-2021-08-03-at-12.54.21-PM.png 2234w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>We use Jenkins <strong>CasC</strong> (Configuration as Code) plugin to deploy configuration on Jenkins. So accesses of each job are mapped to individuals in a <strong>YAML</strong> file while deploying. This mapping is templated in the helm values file in the form of permissions and the user matrix, which specifies all the permissions and maps these permissions to users. This matrix is translated to Jenkins permissions by the helm.<br></p><p><strong>Sample template</strong>:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/code-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Our journey to managing Jenkins on AWS EKS\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/code-1.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/code-1.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/code-1.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/code-1.png 2008w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>This is translated into the ✅ in the corresponding check box in the above image, which Jenkins uses.</p><p><br>The data for populating this user matrix is fetched from an API exposed to the internal tool we have built for access management. This tool handles the complete lifecycle of a request, from creating a request to approving and revoking access. The JSON data returned by this API is templated into a generic template by ansible, which creates the “Configuration as Code” file for Jenkins. More about this is mentioned in the “<strong>Jenkins Deployment via Ansible</strong>” section below.</p><h3 id=\"shared-library-functions\"><br>Shared Library functions</h3><p>The idea of managing all the Jenkins jobs as code to make the system reproducible wasn’t much of a complex problem to solve as this idea had been floating over the internet for a while. <br>Maintenance of the code was something we were concerned with. Almost all of the jobs had a few generic components like authentication with various components like AWS, Hashicorp Vault, sending notifications, fetching relevant keys/information from secrets, etc.</p><p>Managing these steps separately for every job would have added overhead of maintenance effort as any change would have to be made for all jobs. This issue was solved by using a list of shared functions committed in the repository as a separate file, and these functions are called in job pipelines.</p><p><strong>The shared functions are imported using the following line in pipeline:</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/code-2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Our journey to managing Jenkins on AWS EKS\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/code-2.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/code-2.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/code-2.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/code-2.png 1696w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Here, ‘<strong>master</strong>’ is the branch from which the files need to be picked.

These predefined images have all the required packages installed</li><li><strong>Service Account</strong> - This specifies the Kubernetes service account, which will be associated with the pod. Most of the accesses like AWS access, fetching secrets, etc., have been linked to these service accounts.</li><li><strong>Node Selector</strong> - We have defined different kinds of nodes based on the types of tasks they need to run. SSH access to different components is defined separately for different node groups.</li></ul><p><br><em><strong>Example</strong></em>: For a Jenkins job that runs Ansible, the container that comes up needs to have Ansible installed</p><p>So we have different docker images for different types of jobs.</p><h3 id=\"using-helm\">Using Helm</h3><p><a href=\"https://helm.sh/\">Helm</a> is a tool that makes maintenance and deployment of Kubernetes applications easy. All the configuration is maintained in the form of charts. Charts make maintenance and versioning of configuration easy. We use the <a href=\"https://github.com/jenkinsci/helm-charts\">Jenkins Helm Chart</a> as the base and overwrite all the custom configurations like secrets, permissions matrix, environment variables, etc. All the Kubernetes configurations like namespace, nodeSelector, resources, docker images, etc., are also maintained in the same file. This file used for overwriting default values is templated via ansible during the deployment.</p><h3 id=\"jenkins-deployment-via-ansible\">Jenkins Deployment via Ansible</h3><p>Jenkins is used for deployments on servers. So to set up Jenkins itself, we need automation as well. Even though helm charts have made the deployment process easy, Jenkins deployment in our setup required a couple of more steps-</p><ul><li>Checking the cluster as we use different clusters for production and staging.</li><li>Fetching some keys required for Jenkins plugins like slackNotification, git, etc.</li><li>Fetching the user permissions from an API exposed on our internal tool.</li><li>Templating the secrets and user matrix to generate a helm file and running the deployment.</li><li>Creating 2 ingress controllers for internal and external traffic.</li></ul><p>To make this process even simpler, we used Ansible, which makes all the checks on the existing Kubernetes cluster and deploys changes to Jenkins or brings up Jenkins from scratch if it does not exist. This deployment also adds Job Generator to Jenkins as a Starting point. This allowed us to deploy changes to Jenkins with a single command. We have Kubernetes CronJob that runs twice a day which updates the access matrix for adding new accesses. It gets an access matrix from an internal access management tool and secrets from the vault to do a deployment.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/2.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Our journey to managing Jenkins on AWS EKS\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/2.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/2.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/2.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/2.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"jenkins-and-plugins-upgrade\">Jenkins and plugins Upgrade</h3><p>When using any system, it is necessary to upgrade it from time to time. For Jenkins deployment using Kubernetes, it takes just a few minutes to bring up a new Jenkins Pod and start using it.</p><p>We create a new Jenkins Image with new Jenkins image/ plugin versions for the upgrade process, test the image by deploying it on staging Jenkins, and then deploy it to production.<br>If anything goes wrong with this new upgrade, we can always revert the deployment using the older image in the \"Configuration as a Code\" file.</p><h3 id=\"notification-system\">Notification System</h3><p>Jenkins has a wide range of options for sending notifications. We use slack internally in the company, so we decided to stick with that for job notifications. We use notification for Job completion alerts to deployers. Jenkins already had an easy-to-configure plugin for slack notifications, which allowed sending notifications to any user/channel. We wrote a function on top of this plugin to send a customized notification as needed by us.</p><h3 id=\"making-jenkins-private-and-remote-triggers\">Making Jenkins Private and remote triggers</h3><p>Considering the security aspects, we wanted Jenkins to be only accessible internally using VPN. This was achieved using an internal load balancer which allowed traffic only from private IPs in the network.</p><p>To fully utilize the capabilities of a CI/CD system, we also wanted to integrate the system with GitHub PR checks and remote triggers. The private load balancer did not allow for this directly. This problem was solved using two different ingress controllers, one for internal traffic and open to all routes and a second one for remote triggers open to only specific jobs and routes. The reverse proxy setup allowed GitHub to trigger jobs remotely while not compromising the system's security.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/3-1.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Our journey to managing Jenkins on AWS EKS\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/3-1.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/3-1.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/3-1.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/3-1.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"the-final-result\">The final result</h3><p>This is how our final architecture looks like at the end of our journey:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/4.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Our journey to managing Jenkins on AWS EKS\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/4.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/4.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/4.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/4.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>At high-level, we have a highly scalable Jenkins setup and a centralized configuration to manage.</p><p></p><p><strong>To show what we mean by the above statement, take a look at our old and new architecture</strong>:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/2021/08/5--old-vs-new-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Our journey to managing Jenkins on AWS EKS\" srcset=\"https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/08/5--old-vs-new-.png 600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/08/5--old-vs-new-.png 1000w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/08/5--old-vs-new-.png 1600w, https://www.browserstack.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/08/5--old-vs-new-.png 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In the old architecture, we have multiple Jenkins to manage, from infrastructure to its configuration.

Let’s look at the improvements we have made with this refactor:</p><ul><li>No production deploys from local machines. For any deployment, developers can create a job easily by pushing the job pipeline in the code repo.</li><li>Jobs' waiting time has come down as when Jobs are triggered, new AWS instances are booted(if all resources are busy) to run the job and terminated after done.</li><li>When the Jobs are not running, all the Jenkins salves are scaled-down, so it saves a lot of AWS resources compared to previous setups where Jenkins slaves were UP at all times.</li><li>Developers have only build access to jobs, and any modifications in Job is done through PR reviews.</li><li>Very low maintenance of Jenkins because if Jenkins Container goes down, it is automatically brought back up by Kubernetes.</li><li>Upgrading Jenkins has become easy.</li><li>It took four months to build this system and migrating existing jobs from different deployment systems.</li></ul><p></p><h3 id=\"closing-thoughts\">Closing thoughts</h3><p>Is it a panacea for our CI/CD issues? Honestly, no one can say that in software industry with certainty. But software engineering is all about context, use case, and trade-offs, or more famously, “It depends”. No matter how advanced the systems are, there is always a flaw or a need for refactoring that arises in the future due to many reasons like improvement in the technology, increase in user base, organisation expansion, etc.</p><p><strong>But did our engineers do their best to address the issue and create a solution that would last for substantial years to come? Absolutely!</strong></p>"

The conference set for 2021 is sure to be full of exciting workshops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The conference will be held on April 20th at 11 AM EST</em></strong>, but if you can’t make it, you will be sent a recording of the workshop. You can register <a href=\"https://saucecon.com/workshops/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <strong>save 50%</strong> by applying the <strong>coupon code</strong> <strong>ADV0424</strong> on the payment page. You should be sure to register soon if you are interested because seats are limited!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many exciting Sauce Con workshops to choose from at this conference, but here are our <strong><em>top 5picks</em></strong> that you shouldn’t miss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*yB59sBS3WKS7QC_r\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Crafting a Test Framework</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This advanced workshop is 4 hours long and walks you through testing a sample application that will help you see how each component works together to streamline the process and make it easier to update your code when needed. Creating a framework that is efficient and easy to use will help you reduce costs because the most expensive part of a Selenium test suite is the maintenance costs which tend to eat up more of your budget than creation or execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workshop will start with discussing how to write good tests and using test data. Then it will move into working with objects on a page and synchronization. Next is encapsulating objects and performing tests at scale. You will learn to prioritize the right things when creating test tooling and how the different framework parts work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to get the most out of this workshop, you should already have experience with Java. You should also have Git, IntelliJ, and JDK v1.8 or higher installed. This workshop is ideal for testers who either have already written or plan to write automation frameworks. It will also be beneficial for testers who maintain a framework that needs some major improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workshop leader is Titus Fortner, a Senior Solutions Architect at Sauce Labs. You can learn more about him via his <a href=\"https://titusfortner.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/titusfortner\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter account</a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/titusfortner\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub profile</a>. He will be assisted by two solution architects, Chris Eccleston and Eyal Yovel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f449.png\" alt=\"👉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><a href=\"https://saucecon.com/workshops/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Register for <strong>Crafting a Test Framework</strong> led by Titus Fortner</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4b0.png\" alt=\"💰\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />Use coupon code <strong>ADV0424</strong> to save 50%</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Run Your Tests&nbsp;Anywhere</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This basic level, 4-hour course, will walk you through using Docker to run JavaScript or Java tests without Node or Java installed. This freedom allows you or a colleague to run tests on any laptop or using a remote Continuous Integration server (CI). Docker is usually used to package and deploy applications in diverse environments, but it will also help anyone in any location be able to test frontend and backend applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obtaining an understanding of Docker, how it works, how to create images, and how to run containers will help you navigate through the tricky beginning stages of using Docker. This workshop helps you grasp these concepts to be able to run tests with hands-on exercises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workshop will cover a lot of the basics like an introduction and quick environment check so you understand the basics of <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=dockerhomepage&amp;utm_content=namer&amp;utm_term=dockerhomepage&amp;utm_budget=growth&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwgZuDBhBTEiwAXNofRAX9tCO3cYRXn5KY5vOsHf-6oRVKY85QdZiqhuzBugLszZXTjST1hRoC2KEQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Docker</a> and the testing application that will be used in the workshop. It will also instruct you on how to put the application in Docker, run it, write a few tests, and run them inside a container.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will also run several Docker containers with docker-compose to be able to test applications using different environments. Before a wrap-up, we will run tests in a continuous integration pipeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This workshop is ideal for developers, testers, DevOps, or anyone interested in testing. You will understand how an application can be put into containers to make testing easier and scale-up test suites by running them in different environments. You will also be able to coordinate multiple Docker containers to make setup and execution easier. You will also be able to put in different elements to build test setups that are customized to your testing needs and be able to use a continuous integration pipeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the workshop, you should be able to run command-line tools from your workstation, have basic programming knowledge, and have the latest version of Docker installed. It would also be helpful to have a good text editor and a GitHub account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workshop will be led by Diego Moina, a Senior Software Engineer, and assisted by another Senior Software Engineer, Eli Flores. You can connect with Diego Moina via his <a href=\"https://www.diemol.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/diegofmolina\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter account</a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/diemol\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub profile</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f449.png\" alt=\"👉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><a href=\"https://saucecon.com/workshops/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Register for <strong>Run Your Tests Anywhere</strong> led by Diego Moina</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f4b0.png\" alt=\"💰\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />Use coupon code <strong>ADV0424</strong> to save 50%</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*OSvS9nCHFndzTHme\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. The Nuts and Bolts of WebDriverio</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This basic level, 4-hour course will teach you how to use browser automation and give you practical experience that you can apply to your projects at your workplace. This workshop is ideal for anyone from beginners who are just getting started as well as professionals who are looking for more information on complex interaction in browsers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take the workshop, you should have a browser on your operating system, as well as the latest Node JS and <a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Python</a>, installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The workshop leader is Christian Bromann, a Staff Software Engineer. You can learn more about him via his <a href=\"http://www.christian-bromann.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bromann\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter account</a>, or <a href=\"https://github.com/christian-bromann\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub profile</a>.

As a result, these UI tests are usually only scheduled once a day or once per release.</p><p>But what if these tests were run more frequently, at each pull request? Would there be a significant improvement in release quality? Let's find out.</p><p>In this post, we will go over:</p><ul><li>Why you should test at every pull request</li><li>How to choose what tests to run</li><li>How to set up a pipeline to automatically test and validate PRs</li></ul><h2 id=\"why-is-running-end-to-end-ui-tests-for-each-pr-important\">Why is running end-to-end UI tests for each PR important?</h2><p>Running end-to-end UI tests for each PR can be extremely beneficial when done right.</p><p>At Carousell, it helps identify major issues caused by changes much earlier in the development cycle. After introducing this, we were able to identify some of the crashes and major UI bugs much earlier in the cycle. So, finding and fixing changes before a release becomes much easier.</p><p>Usually, an app's unit tests will mock external dependencies. When you run the E2E tests in a stable environment, it validates those integrations as well.</p><p>Lastly, running functional tests with unit tests bolsters developers' confidence in release quality.</p><h2 id=\"choosing-the-right-tests-for-an-efficient-pipeline-\">Choosing the right tests for an efficient pipeline:</h2><p>While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to choosing tests for an efficient pipeline, here are a few considerations:</p><ul><li>Choose essential tests that don't take too long to run or increase developers' wait time before merging the code.</li><li>Cover the most critical workflows (P0 or basic) to ensure your application is not breaking essential functionality. Add other tests if you have the bandwidth.</li><li>Do not consider this a replacement for your unit test or regression suite.

These include key test automation tools like Selenium and Appium. About a year ago, we decided to actively contribute to the Open Source community and built a dedicated Open Source engineering team to contribute to projects which move the testing industry forward. Our team is young, ambitious and eager to make an impact. Outlined below are our guiding principles:</p><h3 id=\"we-are-working-in-the-open\">We are working in the open</h3><p>Since the Open Source team’s inception, BrowserStack wanted to make sure that we are good stewards in the projects we join. We have also needed to get used to being out in the open as an engineering organisation. A worthwhile, and a challenging, initiative that we have relished.</p><h3 id=\"we-want-to-help-each-project-deliver-\">We want to help each project deliver…</h3><p>On their promises, on their culture. This means that when we embed in a project, we want to be full members of the project and support it to be successful!</p><h3 id=\"we-focus-on-projects-which-move-the-testing-industry-forward\">We focus on projects which move the testing industry forward</h3><p>BrowserStack can’t be doing everything, but when we do engage, we will bring our experience from building BrowserStack to those projects. We know we can’t support everyone as much as we would like to, we are going to be very deliberate about where we can support projects.</p><p>With this in mind, the BrowserStack Open Source organization, led by David Burns, will be focusing on contributing to the Selenium open source project.</p><p>This is just the beginning of our journey in the open source world—stay tuned for exciting updates from the Open Source engineering team over the next few months.</p>"
